      # By default, this returns an instance of
      # [Google::Cloud::ServiceUsage::V1::ServiceUsage::Client](https://cloud.google.com/ruby/docs/reference/google-cloud-service_usage-v1/latest/Google-Cloud-ServiceUsage-V1-ServiceUsage-Client)
      # for a gRPC client for version V1 of the API.
      # However, you can specify a different API version by passing it in the
      # `version` parameter. If the ServiceUsage service is
      # supported by that API version, and the corresponding gem is available, the
      # appropriate versioned client will be returned.

      # ## About ServiceUsage
      #
      # Enables services that service consumers want to use on Google Cloud Platform,
      # lists the available or enabled services, or disables services that service
      # consumers no longer use.
      #
      # See [Service Usage API](https://cloud.google.com/service-usage/docs/overview)
      #
      # @param version [::String, ::Symbol] The API version to connect to. Optional.
      #   Defaults to `:v1`.
      # @return [::Object] A client object for the specified version.
